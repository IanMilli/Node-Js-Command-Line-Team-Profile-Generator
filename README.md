   ## Description

   This project is to create a command line application that generates an HTML based on user input. In this case we are generating a HTML file to display a coding teams information for easy access during a project development.

   ## UserStory

   As a manager, I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info, SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

   ## Development

   I first read through the project readme and starter code. I then reviewed a helpful video prepared by the instructor Mr Dane Edwards. Following this video i initialized my repository. After I had successfully worked through the start of the project i applied knowledge i gained from week 12 classes as well as from research i carried out in the MDN Documentation and proceeded to develop the code based on the provided test code. Once I ensured all tests were met successfully i then moved onto the js node code that will work with inquirer modules to produce the command line questions that a user must respond to in order to generate a html file. I proceeded to add code that altered the starter code css to make the produced file more responsive and added links so emails can be generated with a click of a button to team members or if on a mobile device a phone call can be made by clicking on the individuals phone number.

   ## Usage

   To use this application follow the guidance under [Installation](#installation). Once the application is running Input the requested information for your team members. Once the questions reach an end point a HTML file will be generated that can then be exported to where you require it.

   ## Screenshots

   yes, this is a placeholder for screenshots to be added

   ## Tests

   To test if the code meets the parameters of the requirements of the project, in the intergrated Terminal input 'npm run test' . This should bring up a screenshot similar to the one below:

   ## Evolution

   To evolve this project:
   
   * The code could be altered to display Manager, Engineer and Intern Cards on related rows instead of a long column.

   * Greater information could be added to the generated cards for a more detailed profile of each team member.

   * The data could be stored in a central database such as SQL that then can be extracted for multiple apps on a singular system.
